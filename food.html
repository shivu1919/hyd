                    <li>Unique Preparation Method: Irani Chai is distinct from traditional Indian chai because the tea decoction and milk are brewed separately. The tea leaves are boiled for a long time to create a strong, concentrated tea, while the milk is simmered separately until thick and creamy, often using full-cream or water buffalo milk for richness.</li>
                    <li>Rich, Creamy Texture with Special Ingredients: A defining feature of Irani Chai is its velvety texture achieved by adding milk solids like mawa (khoya) or condensed milk to the simmered milk. This gives the chai a luxurious, sweet, and creamy flavor that sets it apart from regular masala chai.</li>

                    <li>Cultural and Historical Significance: Originating from Irani cafés established by Persian immigrants in cities like Hyderabad and Mumbai, Irani Chai is more than just a beverage; it represents a cultural melting pot where people from diverse backgrounds gather. The tea is traditionally enjoyed with local snacks such as Osmania biscuits and is an iconic part of Hyderabadi café culture.</li>
