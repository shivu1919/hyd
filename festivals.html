                    <li>Cultural Significance and Origin: Bathukamma is a vibrant floral festival celebrated predominantly by women in Telangana and some parts of Andhra Pradesh. It symbolizes Telangana's cultural identity and is dedicated to Goddess Parvati, also known as Devi Sati, who is believed to come back to life during this festival.</li>

                    <li>Timing and Duration: The festival typically occurs in September or October, lasting nine days. It begins on Bhadrapada Purnima (Mahalaya Amavasya) and concludes on Durgashtami, just before Dussehra. Each day has a specific name and significance, culminating in the final day called Saddula Bathukamma.</li>

                    <li>Floral Arrangements and Rituals: Central to the festival is the creation of intricate flower arrangements called Bathukammas, made from seasonal wildflowers unique to the region, such as gunuka poolu, tangedu poolu, marigold, and chrysanthemum. Women gather flowers, arrange them on a brass plate called Thambalam, sing folk songs, and perform traditional dances around the Bathukamma.</li>
